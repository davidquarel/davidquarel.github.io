I spent some time as both a student and a teaching assisstant 
at the second edition of [ARENA](https://www.arena.education/), an 
AI Alignment upskilling workshop running in London, June 2023.

I gave some talks on Reinforcement Learning, covering the basics (bandits, MDPs, tabular learning, SARSA, Q-Learning) and some exploration of other RL methods
such as DQN and VPG. Here are 
the slides (<a href="/files/arena/rl_arena_handout.pdf" target="_blank">handout</a> and <a href="/files/arena/rl_arena_present.pdf" target="_blank">present</a>) 
and the corresponding <a href="/files/arena/rl_arena.tex" target="_blank">tex source</a>.  

**NB**: don't trust the PPO material, I didn't end up using it, 
but it's included for posterity, and will likely change for future iterations.
