Hello!  I'm David Quarel. I wanted to get into writing for reasons detailed
[here]({% post_url 2024-02-04-Do-the-thing %}), so I made this blog.

I (will?) write about AI safety, rationality, effective teaching,
and whatever else I find interesting. Probably some personal stuff
about my life and moving to London from Australia, and why you should too.

Below is a serious bio written in the third 
person using stern prose so I can copy-paste it into things more serious
than this blog.
