### Last Update: 14th June, 2023

* I live in the UK now, and have been here since Feburary
* Currently attending/tutoring at [ARENA](https://arena.education)
* Collaborating with others at [Cambridge AI Safety Hub](https://www.cambridgeaisafety.org/)
* Almost finished a [book](http://hutter1.net/ai/uaibook2.htm) I'm co-authoring, to be published soon(?)
* Finally getting around to making a website now that large language models are good enough
to hold my hand through the process
