### Update: 18th Aug, 2024

* I live in London now, and I spend my time at [LISA](safeai.org.uk) on various projects. 
    * Exploring causal interventions to explore the claim that [Llama-2 "thinks" in English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588)
    * Use mechanistic interpretability techniques to work out the mechanism by which a LSTM trained to play sudoku does [forward planning](https://far.ai/publication/garrigaalonso2024learnedplanners/). 
* I'm the head TA at [ARENA](https://arena.education), a technical AI safety upskilling program.
* Going to try again (perhaps in futility) to make a habit of writing more often here. Have a backlog of posts to clean and publish.
* On ~May 2024 [my book released](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/?id=jqQIEQAAQBAJ)!
