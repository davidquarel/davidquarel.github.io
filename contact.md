Feel free to email me at `davidquarel[at]gmail[dot]com` or message me on
`dquarel.99` on Signal. If you want to video call or meet in person, 
you can book me on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/davidquarel), either online or 
in person at the 
[London Initiative for Safe AI (LISA)](https://www.safeai.org.uk/) office in London. 


### Tutoring

I used to do a lot of freelance work as a tutor, so if you're interested in
that, you can check out my [tutoring page](https://studentvip.com.au/tutors/9516/david)
and hire me. Steep discounts
for those in Effective Altruism, looking to work in AI safety, or if I know you
personally, and I won't 
charge for the first session if you don't think it was worth it. I'd prefer 
in person in London (I can come to you!), but otherwise I'm happy to do online
sessions.
